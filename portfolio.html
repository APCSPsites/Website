    <a> A tutorial game that instructs the player how to make two sushi rolls, a California Roll and a Salmon Roll. The player gets to assemble, roll, cut, and plate the sushi. 
	    They type in key words when prompted to make the program lay out the proper ingredients in the right order. If they don't enter the right key words at the right time, the game ends and they have to restart.</a>

    <a> A take on the classic Fruit Ninja game where fruit are thrown up in the air and when clicked they are cut and fall. Unlike the origanal, different fruits are worth different amounts depending on size.
    We used images as turtles for all the fruit and cut versions of the fruit so that they could move and be clicked on to enact actions like the fruit cutting. There is a timer in the game and the goal is to cut
    as much fruit as possible in that time limit. When the timer is up, the game ends and you can not cut any more fruit.</a>

    <h1>   Trench Run</h1>

    <a> A remix Scratch plane game inspired by the trench run in Star Wars. The player has the choice of using either the arrow keys or the mouse to control an x-wing fighter and fly it though the obstacle walls as it 
    flys through the trench. Any time the x-wing fighter hits a wall it explodes in a fire ball, making an explosion sound, and the game ends. The game is split up into three levels and then three sub leves inside each level.
    The game saves progress, so if you die, you can restart at the start of the level and sublevel you were on.</a>

    <a> An investigation into a system breach through email phishing and poor security and the decryption and repair of corrupted files to get a fish tank tracking system running properly. We had to discover where the breach 
    origanated, what files were damaged, what the issues in the damaged code were, and fix them. OUr goal was to get the fish tank monitoring system to run properly again and advise the agency on how to upgrade their security
    to prevent another breach. We were able to get the system to run smoothly and properly and gave feedback to the agency security advice to keep it from happening again.</a>
